                <p>Period: Jun/2022 - Jun/2023</p>
                <p>Research focused on wind turbines financed by Petrobr√°s. Briefly, the objective of this initiation research is to add information to the studies that have been carried out on floating offshore wind turbines. Contributing, along with other research, to make the energy transition a more efficient and faster process. In a more specific way, it is intended to study and compare alternatives of control approaches for the rotation of the power train of a floating offshore wind turbine as a function of the different regions of wind speed, without leaving aside the restrictions regarding the maximum amplitude of the wind speed. angular movement of the ‚Äúpitch‚Äù of the platform as well as the maximum acceleration of the nacelle, challenges that demanded a lot of study time.</p>
